## Overview

As we know, prepending model inputs with **safety prompts** is a common means for safeguarding large language models (LLMs) from complying with harmful queries. This practice has been adopted in real-world deployed LLMs like ChatGPT and Mistral.

Do you know **how safety prompts intrinsically work in LLM safeguarding**? Our work reveals their working mechanisms from the perspective of **model representations**, and opens the potential for automatically optimizing them to improve LLM safety.

We find that in models’ representation space, harmful and harmless queries can be largely distinguished, but this is not noticeably enhanced by safety prompts (the below figure **upper**). Instead, the queries’ representations are moved by safety prompts in similar directions where models become more prone to refusing to provide assistance (the below figure **lower**) even when the queries are harmless.

Inspired by these findings, we propose a method called **DRO (Directed Representation Optimization)** for automatic safety prompt optimization. It treats safety prompts as continuous, trainable embeddings and learns to **move the representations of harmful/harmless queries along/opposite the direction in which the model’s refusal probability increases**.

Experiments with eight LLMs on out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that DRO remarkably improves the safeguarding performance of human-crafted safety prompts and outperforms strong baselines, without compromising the general model capability.
